Add PWM and SPI ouput support
Add Midi CC Parser to trigger the right handles

For MIDI:
Add support for:
Bn 7B 00 messages - All notes off (sent on stop while stopped in fl (i.e double press of stop) and general init)
F8 - Realtime MIDI Clock
FA - Start (sent on play in fl)
FC - Stop (sent on pause in fl and stop whilst playing in fl)
FB - Continue (sent on play when continuing from previous point in fl)
Dont bother with MTC Quarter Frames
Note - FL sends note off messages for any notes that dont have time to reach their note end cos playback is stopped
