Add SPI ouput support
Add Midi CC Parser to trigger the right handles

Remove switches from hardware design and replace with digi outs on those pins giving 16th notes and midi clock reset

For MIDI:
Add support for:
Bn 7B 00 messages - All notes off (sent on stop while stopped in fl (i.e double press of stop) and general init) - its a cc message i think


design hardware to take clock and rst signals which are currently at 6 clocks/quarter note and output probably as separate module:
4 bar
2 bar
1 bar
1/2 note
1/4 note triplet
1/4 note
1/8 note triplet
1/8 note
1/16 note triplet
1/16 note
