Add PWM and SPI ouput support
Add Midi CC Parser to trigger the right handles

Remove switches from hardware design and replace with digi outs on those pins giving quarter notes and another 16th note, or a digital output maybe

For MIDI:
Add support for:
Bn 7B 00 messages - All notes off (sent on stop while stopped in fl (i.e double press of stop) and general init)
F8 - Realtime MIDI Clock
FA - Start (sent on play in fl)
FC - Stop (sent on pause in fl and stop whilst playing in fl)
FB - Continue (sent on play when continuing from previous point in fl)
Dont bother with MTC Quarter Frames
Note - FL sends note off messages for any notes that dont have time to reach their note end cos playback is stopped

Add tuning mode for calibrating pitch amplifiers
